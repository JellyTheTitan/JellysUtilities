# What is Jelly's Utilities?
**Jelly's Utilities** is a custom TurboWarp extension, with a variety of helpful blocks for all kinds of situations.

# How do I use it?
1. Download the project as a `.zip` folder.
2. Open TurboWarp in your browser or open the offline editor.
3. Once it has loaded, open the editor (if you are in your browser),
   and click on the *"Add Extension"* button, located at the bottom-left corner.
4. Scroll until you see an option called *"Custom Extension"*. Click on it.
5. It will open a prompt with three different options. Select the *"File"* option.
6. Click on the prompt and your computer's file app should open.
7. Open the `.zip` folder and select the file called `jellysutilities.js`.
8. Once it has uploaded, select the checkbox that says "Run extension without sandbox".
   ***This step is very important, as the extension will not upload and throw an error in
   the JavaScript console.***
